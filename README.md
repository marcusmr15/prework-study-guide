# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The motivation for this project project came alongside my motivation learn code. I had previous codign expereince when I was in college while studying the Audio Engineering bachelor's degree. There, I learned a bit of C#, C++, and Python, and I used that knowledge to make a little game for an assignment in which the priority was using Wwise to add audio to the game. The game per se, was very basic but it woke my desire to learn to code. I ultimately ended up working as a QA Tester, which only increased my desire to dive deep into the development world.

I built this project in order to learn-by-doing basic concepts regarding web development like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; as well as learning to use Mac's Terminal, using Git commands and GitHub. But most importantly, it helped to further stablish and adopt a growth mindset. 

This prework study guide is of great help as not only does it cointains information regarding technical concepts that I learned through this assignment, but I was also able to aplly them in a real-life scenario, which prepares the student for the bootcamp and professional life alike.

I learned that problems/issues/errors are sure to arise, but we also have the benefit of having access to the internet and all the resources it provides. I believe there's no better way to be good at something or learn something new by just doping it yourself. No matter how weel expalined something is, unless you get your hand "dirty" (to call it somehow) and start doing it. Making mistakes is the best way to learn, because they are what truly makes you better each day, even though it can be frustrating or unencouraging at time.
